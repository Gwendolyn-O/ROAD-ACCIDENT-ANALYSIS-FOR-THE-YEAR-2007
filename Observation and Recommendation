The road accident analysis for the year 2007 reveals several insights:

Weather Conditions Impact: The highest number of accidents occurred under "Fine + high winds" conditions, followed by "Raining + no high winds." This suggests that while fine weather with high winds contributes significantly to accidents, rainy conditions also play a major role.

Accident Severity and Speed Limits: Accidents occurred at speed limits totaling up to 12M across both urban and rural areas, with a nearly equal split (around 47% urban, 53% rural). This balance indicates that rural areas might have more high-speed accidents, contributing to the higher casualty numbers.

Road Surface and Vehicle Count: The majority of accidents took place on dry roads, with a relatively low occurrence on wet or icy roads. This suggests that factors other than road surface, like driver behavior or traffic density, may be influencing accident rates.

Day of Week Trends: Friday has the highest number of casualties (68K), followed closely by Wednesday and Tuesday. Sunday has the lowest casualty count, likely due to reduced traffic volume on that day.

Road Type and Casualties: Single carriageway roads have the highest casualty rate, with 310K casualties, far exceeding other road types like dual carriageways and roundabouts.

Vehicle Type Involvement: Cars are involved in the majority of accidents, with 0.33M casualties. Other vehicle types like motorcycles and vans have significantly lower casualty counts.

 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Targeted Safety Campaigns: Implement road safety awareness campaigns focusing on high-risk days (especially Friday) and weather conditions with high accident rates (e.g., "Fine + high winds" and "Raining + no high winds").

Speed Control Measures: Since accidents are equally distributed across urban and rural areas, consider implementing stricter speed control measures on rural roads, especially on single carriageways where most accidents occur.

Improved Signage on Single Carriageways: Install more visible signage, barriers, and reflectors on single carriageway roads to reduce accidents, as they are the most accident-prone road type.

Road Surface and Weather Alerts: Promote real-time alerts for high-wind and rainy conditions, encouraging drivers to exercise caution during these weather patterns.

Focused Vehicle Safety Regulations for Cars: Given that cars have the highest casualty numbers, implement or enhance safety regulations for car drivers, such as regular vehicle maintenance checks and driver education
